# Sprint 1: News Paper Assignment

Today's assignment is to create a classig newspaper grid that lists articles that is responsive and works both for desktop, tablet and mobile. We are going to use the webpage [kit.se](https://kit.se/) and make our version of their grid, for desktop, tablet and phone. The section we will focus on looks like this on desktop:

## How to complete this assignment

First, read more about `media queries` – you have some great reads listed below. 

Second, inspect Kit's webpage in the inspector and look how the page changes for mobile and tablet. [Here's a great instruction on how to do that](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) Make a plan and note on each item listed below, how that changes when you change screen size. 

**Each article should include:**
* A background image
* A headline
* An author
* A link to the real article

Don't worry about the background color behind the headline, let's leave that for the streach goals. 

The `starter-code` folder containers a boilerplate html file and a starting CSS-file. Start by making the mobile version and then work your way up – mobile first! You will be reviewed on your code for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, add your code to your repository, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. [Read the guide on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more info on how to do this.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Re-arrange the layout on the cards so that the author is above the title on mobile – but keep the existing layout for the other screen sizes. 
1. Implement the background color of the headlines as on kit.se. This is a little tricky but [here's a great guide](https://css-tricks.com/multi-line-padded-text/) to multiple approaches. We have faith in you! 
1. Implement the same effect on hover as kit.se.
